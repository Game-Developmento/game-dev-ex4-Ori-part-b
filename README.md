This is a two-player game where each player controls a cube and shoots ducks at each other. The players are positioned at opposite ends of the screen, and they can move left or right within their boundaries. Each player has three lives, and they win by eliminating their opponent's lives.

2. Player 1 moves left or right using the A and D keys and shoots with the spacebar.
3. Player 2 moves left or right using the arrow keys and shoots with the / key.
4. Each player can shoot only once every 0.5 seconds.
5. If a duck hits a player, they are immune for 2.5 seconds, during which time they cannot be hit again.
6. If a player loses all their lives, the game is over and the other player wins.

## Notes
- The ducks will be destroyed if they are not in sight of the camera, which prevents objects from accumulating and slowing down the game.
- There is a delay between each duck spawn to prevent players from spamming shots.
- The players have boundaries that limit how far they can move left or right.
- The game is intended for two players, so make sure you have a friend to play with!
